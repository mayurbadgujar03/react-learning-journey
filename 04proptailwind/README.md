# React Props & Tailwind CSS: Learning Project ðŸš€

This project explores the fundamentals of **React Props** and styling with **Tailwind CSS**. Through this app, I learned how to pass dynamic data using props and utilize Tailwind's utility classes for clean, responsive, and modern UI designs.

---

## ðŸ›  Features
- **Dynamic Components with Props:**  
  - Implemented reusable `Card` components that accept `username` and `btntext` as props.
  - Props allow for flexibility and modularity in component-based architecture.

- **Tailwind CSS Styling:**  
  - Styled the UI using Tailwind's utility-first CSS classes.
  - Created responsive, rounded, and visually appealing designs effortlessly.

## ðŸ“š What I Learned
1. **React Props:**
   - Props (`username`, `btntext`) are used to pass data from parent to child components.
   - Props make components reusable and dynamic.
   - Syntax:
     ```jsx
     <Card username="Mayur" btntext="Click me" />
     ```

2. **Tailwind CSS:**
   - Utility-first approach simplifies styling without writing custom CSS.
   - Classes like `bg-green-400`, `text-black`, `p-4`, and `rounded-2xl` add functionality directly in the markup.
   - Easy to create responsive and visually consistent designs.
